The purpose of this project was mainly focused on the backend, the point was to create an application to run a Smart Packaging Monitoring Application
that aims to track and analyze real-time data from sensors embedded in product packaging. 
These sensors monitor temperature, atmospheric pressure, acceleration, and GPS positioning, transmitting data wirelessly from activation to delivery
to ensure product quality. 
This was developed in Java using Jakarta EE, token-based authentication for users, concurrency management methods, Hibernate and Lazy Loading.
